# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Modeling robust oscillatory behavior of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.**   
Kyrylov V, Severyanova LA, Vieira A. _IEEE Trans Biomed Eng._ 2005
Dec;52(12):1977-83. [16366221](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16366221) ,  
**Abstract:**   
A mathematical model of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of the
human endocrine system is proposed. This new model provides an improvement
over previous models by introducing two nonlinear factors with physiological
relevance: 1) a limit to gland size; 2) rejection of negative hormone
concentrations. The result is that the new model is by far the most robust;
e.g., it can tolerate at least -50% and +100% perturbations to any of its
parameters. This high degree of robustness allows one, for the first time, to
model features of the system such as circadian rhythm and response to hormone
injections. In addition, relative to its closest predecessor, the model is
simpler; it contains only about half of the parameters, and yet achieves more
functions. The new model provides opportunities for teaching endocrinology
within a biological or medical school context; it may also have applications
in modeling and studying HPA axis disorders, for example, related to gland
size dynamics, abnormal hormone levels, or stress influences.
